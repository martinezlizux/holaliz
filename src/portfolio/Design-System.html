                <p>An initial audit of the existing design assets revealed several critical issues. A previously initiated component library in Adobe XD had fallen into disuse due to staff turnover during the pandemic. </p>

                <p>Compounding these challenges was the limited availability of resources dedicated to the project. Without a shared component library, the time required for design and development increased significantly. </p>

                <p>Understanding the urgency, the team decided to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the design system using Adobe XD, with plans to transition to Figma in the future. </p>
                <p>They began by defining core design elementsâ€”colors, typography, spacing, and elevationsâ€”aligning them with Atomic Design principles. These foundational elements, referred to as "Atoms," served as the building blocks for more complex components.</p>
                <!-- <p>To ensure compatibility and scalability, the team integrated existing frameworks like Bootstrap and Syncfusion into their design tokens.</p> -->
                <p>Over six weeks, they meticulously created and documented master components, despite the project not being a primary focus on the IT roadmap. This foundational work was crucial in setting the stage for a more efficient and cohesive design process.</p>

                <p>The team focused on creating reusable components that could be easily shared among designers, significantly reducing the time required to build prototypes in Adobe XD. </p>
                <p>This library not only streamlined the design process but also ensured consistency across different projects and teams.</p>
                <p>Recognizing the importance of collaboration between design and development, I  implemented the components into Storybook. A developer assisted me in setting up the repository, categorizing components into Atoms, Molecules, and Templates. Developer added necessary interactions and properties, allowing each component to be configured for various states or versions. This collaborative effort ensured that the components were both design-friendly and developer-ready.</p>
