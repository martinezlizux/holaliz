                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Equal information access:</strong> Logged-in users receive the same information as non-logged-in users, with a focus on card payments rather than promoting the use of points in either case.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of transparency on points:</strong> Users are not informed of their available points at the beginning of the checkout process or while logged in, which reduces awareness of their options.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Flow Interruptions:</strong> Users are pulled out of the purchasing flow when prompted to visit their profile or create an account, disrupting the buying experience.</li>

                        <p>With these insights in hand, I crafted and tested several hypotheses using Optimizely and A/B testing:</p>

                        <p> <strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> Informing users about the benefits of logging in through a popup would facilitate the login process and increase the number of registered users.</p> <br>

                        <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test1.png" alt="AB Header 1">

                        <p> However, after conducting an A/B test, we found no significant results. Determined to refine our approach, we moved on to a second hypothesis.</p>


                        <p> <strong>Hypothesis 2: </strong> If we Change the "call to action" in our button from "Log In" to "Create Account | Log In"  would make it easier for new users to identify where to create an account. This version proved to be successful.</p> <br>
                        <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test2.png" alt="AB Header 1">
                        <p>Encouraged by this outcome, we decided to take it a step further and design a version of the header specifically for logged-in users. This new header displayed the available points in their accounts, providing immediate value and encouraging engagement. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test3-a.png" alt="AB Header 1">

                        <div class="border-bottom py-4">

                            <p>We conducted a final test in which, instead of displaying the points in the user's account, we showed the equivalent amount in currency. This change resulted in the graphs showing a significantly higher conversion rate. Previously, users were unclear about the monetary value of their points. By presenting this information, we motivated them to use their points for their next reservation and enhanced their experience by being more transparent with them. </p>

                        <p>Next, I optimized the checkout flow to make point usage frictionless and rewarding:

                            Default to Rewards: Logged-in users had their points automatically applied at checkout, with visible discounts in their order summary.

                        <li><strong>Keep It Simple for the User: </strong> Using unclear terms can lead to a poor user experience. We learned this when we shifted our communication from points to currency. Users didn’t want to think about what the points represented; when we became clearer, our numbers increased.</li>
                        <li><strong>Small Changes Make a Big Impact:</strong> It’s not necessary to overhaul an entire design to create significant effects. The value lies in the small but important details that can simplify the user experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deliver Value Constantly: </strong>Implementing small but meaningful changes benefits the team, as feeling motivated by these quick wins sustains their energy and drive to continue iterating.</li>
