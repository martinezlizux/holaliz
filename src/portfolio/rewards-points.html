                <p>
                    In today’s competitive online marketplace, optimizing the checkout process is crucial for enhancing user experience and boosting conversion rates. One effective strategy is to incentivize point payments for logged-in users. This approach not only increases the appeal of using loyalty points but also fosters customer engagement and satisfaction. <br>
                </p>

                <!-- <p>The online travel agency's loyalty program allowed users to earn points with each purchase. However, recurring users were not redeeming these points or logging in for their next reservations.  
                </p>
                <p>The business identified the need to increase reservations where users utilize points to pay and improve the experience for those paying with points. <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of personalization:</strong> The interface does not adapt when users are logged in, missing the opportunity to create a tailored experience.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Hidden information: </strong> Users must navigate to their profile to view the cash value of their points, creating unnecessary friction.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Unclear benefits: </strong> Exclusive rates are not perceived as member benefits, and non-logged-in users are not informed about the exclusive rates available to logged-in users. Additionally, the advantages of having an account are not clearly highlighted.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Equal information access:</strong> Logged-in users receive the same information as non-logged-in users, with a focus on card payments rather than promoting the use of points in either case.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of transparency on points:</strong> Users are not informed of their available points at the beginning of the checkout process or while logged in, which reduces awareness of their options.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Flow Interruptions:</strong> Users are pulled out of the purchasing flow when prompted to visit their profile or create an account, disrupting the buying experience.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Lack of Convenience:</strong> The overall process is not simplified for logged-in users, leading to potential frustration.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Absence of Visual Identity:</strong> There is no clear branding for the rewards program within the interface, which could help reinforce its value to users.</li>

                    <!-- <p>After analyzing the data and aiming to improve the experience for our recurring users, we focused on two main objectives and set objectives to cover in this Q1 :</p>

                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">The idea was to formulate hypotheses that we would validate through A/B testing, allowing us to iterate on concepts that would add value and bring us closer to our goal. To set up our experiments, we used the Optimizely tool.</p>

                    <!-- header redesign -->

                    <h4 class="mt-4 bold txt-purple ">Header Redesign</h4>
                    <p> <strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong> Informing users about the benefits of logging in through a popup would facilitate the login process and increase the number of registered users.</p> <br>

                    <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test1.png" alt="AB Header 1">
                    <!-- <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="https://placehold.co/1600x400" alt="Plan"> -->

                    <p> However, after conducting an A/B test, we found no significant results. Determined to refine our approach, we moved on to a second hypothesis.</p>

                  
                    

                    <p> <strong>Hypothesis 2: </strong> If we Change the "call to action" in our button from "Log In" to "Create Account | Log In"  would make it easier for new users to identify where to create an account. This version proved to be successful.</p> <br>
                    <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test2.png" alt="AB Header 1">
                    <p>Encouraged by this outcome, we decided to take it a step further and design a version of the header specifically for logged-in users. This new header displayed the available points in their accounts, providing immediate value and encouraging engagement. </p>
                    <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test3-a.png" alt="AB Header 1">

                    <div class="border-bottom py-4">

                        <p>We conducted a final test in which, instead of displaying the points in the user's account, we showed the equivalent amount in currency. This change resulted in the graphs showing a significantly higher conversion rate. Previously, users were unclear about the monetary value of their points. By presenting this information, we motivated them to use their points for their next reservation and enhanced their experience by being more transparent with them. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-4 rounded-3  shadow " src="../images/projects/Rewards/test4.png" alt="AB Header 1">

                        <p> <strong>Hypothesis 1:</strong>If we set the payment option to points as the default for all logged-in users at checkout and display the associated discount in the purchase summary, then the number of reservations paid with points will increase as users feel more motivated to use their points.</p>
                        <p>We test this idea with an A/B testing , the new version results a winner</p>

                    </div>


                    <p> <strong>Hypothesis 2:</strong>If we enhance the points payment module by clearly indicating the value of the points in the user's account in currency, then users will be more likely to use their points as a payment method.</p>
